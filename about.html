            <p>I am an upcoming web developer with a passion of creating interactive, fun and user friendly websites. 
                I am specializing in front-end development, but I'm also eager to learn more about full-stack development!</p>
            <p>I recently started learning front-end development from The PowerLearn Project Academy which is serving me really well.</p>
            <p>My current goal is to enhance my skills by pushing through with the program till the end so that I can further my understanding in front-end development. 
                I would love to learn about back-end development as well. I hope to use my skills in future in projects to help
            make the world a better place</p>
